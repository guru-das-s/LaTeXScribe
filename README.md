#The LaTeXscribe Letter Generator, version 1.0
May 25, 2012.

##REQUIREMENTS
UNIX platform
Python 2.6.x (not later or earlier versions)
pdflatex
Tkinter

##DESCRIPTION
The Generator provides a minimalist graphical interface to produce a formal letter in the popular pdf format. When you're done entering the details, just press the Button (there's only one!). A new folder named "LaTeXscribe" will be created in the same folder as the LaTeXscribeGEN.py file containing 4 files, one of which is the required letter in pdf form (named LaTeXscribeLetter.pdf). 

##IMPORTANT:
This program has been written for Python 2.6.x and uses Tkinter and pdflatex. It is intended for use only on the UNIX platform. Please ensure you have the appropriate versions of Tkinter and LaTeX installed.

##BUGS and FIXES:
~ It is assumed that the date of running the program is the date that is required on the letter.
